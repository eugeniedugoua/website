Can international environmental agreements induce innovation on green technologies? Noncooperative game theory suggests that agreements only occur when costs to the players are low. This likely happens once technological solutions are available. Agreements then may help diffuse technologies rather than fostering their development. I provide the first quantitative evidence that the Montreal Protocol to protect the ozone layer triggered a large increase in research and innovation on alternatives to ozone-depleting molecules. To do this, I use a DiD design to compare innovation and scientific output related to different molecules. I leverage the full text of patents and scientific articles and apply machine learning-based methods to construct molecule-level chemical and industrial characteristics. My results challenge the view that agreements foster technological diffusion without affecting much of the dynamics of innovation and bear critical implications for how we think about environmental agreements.

<summary> Abstract
</summary>
<div style="text-align: justify">
Previous studies have typically modeled green technological change as innovations in the process through which goods are produced (e.g., abatement technologies or energy sources). But greening the economy also requires changing the products that we use. The automotive industry, for example, needs to deploy large fleets of electric or hydrogen-based vehicles. Product manufacturing nowadays occurs within supply-chain networks, and developing new products typically requires complementary investments by suppliers. In this paper, we study the incentives for green product innovation in industrial networks and how policies can affect them. We follow the industrial organization theory of product differentiation, and model green product innovations as upgrades in product quality where inputs from suppliers are essential for upgrading quality. We show that suppliers can be innovation bottlenecks and render policy instruments less effective. An extension of the model introduces uncertainty in the direction of technological change. Here, we provide an explicit mechanism for the role of institutions that can help actors coordinate on a long-term direction of innovation. Finally, we discuss how our results help organize several findings from case studies in the automotive industry.

Interactions among peers of the same social network play significant roles in facilitating adoption and diffusion of modern technologies in poor communities. We conduct a large-scale randomized controlled trial in rural India to identify the impact of information from friends on willingness to pay (WTP) for high-quality and multi-purpose solar lanterns. We offered solar lanterns to seed households from 200 non-electrified villages and randomly assigned three of their friends to two communication treatments (unincentivized and incentivized) that led them to different exposure to their seed friend. We also introduce a second treatment to investigate whether the seed's gender identity impacts the magnitude of peer effects. We show that, while unincentivized communication increases WTP for solar lanterns by 90% and incentivized communication by 145%, gender doesn't seem to matter. We also show that learning from others is the mechanism that drives the increase in WTP.
